Overview of the Project

Project: Creating a To Do List

Creating a to-do list application involves several steps, from planning the features you want to implement to coding the application itself. Here, I'll guide you through the process of creating a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Step 1: Plan Your Application
Before coding, decide on the basic features you want your to-do list to have. For this example, we'll include:

Adding new tasks.
Displaying a list of tasks.
Marking tasks as completed.
Deleting tasks.
Step 2: Create the HTML Structure
Start by creating the HTML file that will hold the structure of your to-do list.

Step 3: Style the Application
Next, add some basic styling to make your to-do list look presentable.
Step 4: Add Functionality with JavaScript
Finally, add JavaScript to handle adding, marking as completed, and deleting tasks.
Putting It All Together
Create a folder for your project.
Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Copy the respective code into each file.
Open index.html in a web browser.
You should now have a fully functional to-do list application. You can add new tasks, mark them as completed by clicking on them, and delete tasks with the "Delete" button.

Additional Features
You can extend this basic to-do list application with more features, such as:

Storing tasks in the browser's local storage so they persist across sessions.
Adding a priority level to tasks.
Implementing a search functionality to filter tasks.
Allowing the user to edit tasks.
